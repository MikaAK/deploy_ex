# Agents

## Purpose
Top-level Ansible playbooks that provision monitoring and infrastructure services (Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, Redis).

## Working agreements
- Each playbook targets a specific host group and composes roles from `../roles/`.
- Keep playbooks minimal; put logic in roles, not here.
- Ensure host groups match the inventory generated by DeployEx Mix tasks.
